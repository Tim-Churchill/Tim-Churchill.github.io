            <p>Shaping optics with magnetic fields to create continuously tunable focus.</p>

          <h2>A Paramagnetic Liquid Lens: Shaping Optics with Magnetic Fields</h2>
          <p>
            Most optical systems focus light by moving solid components. Glass lenses translate along rails, stacks
            of elements are adjusted mechanically, and focus is achieved through precise but inherently rigid motion.
            While effective, this approach brings unavoidable tradeoffs: inertia, wear, mechanical complexity, and
            limits on speed and smoothness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project explores a different approach -- shaping light by shaping a liquid, using magnetic fields
            instead of motors. Specifically, I am developing a paramagnetic liquid lens, where the curvature of a
            liquid interface -- and therefore the focal length of the lens -- is dynamically controlled by externally
            applied magnetic field gradients.
          </p>

          <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
          <p>
            Paramagnetic liquids are weakly attracted to magnetic fields. Unlike ferromagnetic materials, they do
            not retain magnetization once the field is removed, making them stable, reversible, and well-suited for
            controlled actuation.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a paramagnetic liquid is placed in a container and exposed to a non-uniform magnetic field, it
            experiences a body force proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field strength. This force
            redistributes the liquid, deforming its free surface. Because optical refraction depends on surface
            curvature, reshaping the liquid surface reshapes the lens.
          </p>

          <div class="lens-callout">
            <p>
              Magnetic field to liquid surface deformation to variable focal length. No moving solid optics are required.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Why a Liquid Lens?</h2>
          <p>
            Liquid lenses are not new -- electrowetting lenses are already used in compact cameras and medical devices.
            However, magnetic actuation offers several distinct advantages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contactless control: No electrodes or mechanical actuators interact directly with the optical surface.</li>
            <li>Smooth, continuous deformation: Lens curvature changes continuously rather than in discrete steps.</li>
            <li>Fast response: The dominant limits are fluid dynamics rather than motor inertia.</li>
            <li>Scalability: The same principle applies from millimeter-scale optics to much larger apertures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Paramagnetic liquids, in particular, offer a compelling balance: strong enough magnetic response to be
            useful, without the instability, hysteresis, or optical opacity associated with ferrofluids.
          </p>

          <h2>The Physics (Briefly)</h2>
          <p>
            The magnetic force density acting on a paramagnetic liquid can be expressed (in simplified form) as being
            proportional to:
          </p>
          <div class="equation-block">
            <span class="math">f</span> ∝ <span class="math">χ</span> ∇(<span class="math">B</span><sup>2</sup>)
          </div>
          <p>
            where <span class="math">χ</span> is the magnetic susceptibility of the liquid and <span class="math">B</span>
            is the magnetic field strength. This magnetic force competes with surface tension, gravity, and container
            geometry. The equilibrium surface shape -- and thus the optical behavior of the lens -- emerges from the
            balance of these effects.
          </p>

          <h2>Back-of-Envelope Magnetic Force</h2>
          <p>
            Assume the liquid sits in a spherical volume and four identical magnetic points are equally spaced around
            it. The net force comes from the gradient of the field energy, and the contributions from each point add.
          </p>
          <div class="equation-block">
            <div>F = (chi · V / (2 · mu0)) · grad(B^2)</div>
            <div>grad(B^2) = sum_i grad(B_i^2)</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you want the field to provide a target force (for example, a fraction of the sphere's weight), the
            required field gradient is:
          </p>
          <div class="equation-block">
            <div>grad(B^2) = 2 · mu0 · F / (chi · V)</div>
            <div>F_target = alpha · rho · g · (4/3) · pi · R^3</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            For equal concentration and temperature, paramagnetic susceptibility scales with the square of the
            effective magnetic moment. Using spin-only moments:
          </p>
          <div class="equation-block">
            <div>mu_eff(Gd3+) ≈ 7.94 muB</div>
            <div>mu_eff(Mn2+) ≈ 5.92 muB</div>
            <div>chi_Gd / chi_Mn ≈ (7.94 / 5.92)^2 ≈ 1.80</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            This means, for the same geometry and target force, a gadolinium nitrate solution would need roughly
            0.56× the field gradient required by a manganese chloride solution. The animation below visualizes the
            setup and the scaling.

          <h2>Material Exploration: From Manganese to Gadolinium</h2>
          <h3>Initial Experiments: Manganese Chloride</h3>
          <p>
            The project began with aqueous manganese chloride (MnCl2) solutions. Manganese(II) ions are paramagnetic,
            inexpensive, and easy to work with, making MnCl2 a natural starting point for early experimentation.
            These solutions were used to validate the basic concept: that magnetic field gradients could produce
            measurable and repeatable surface deformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using manganese chloride allowed for rapid iteration on chamber geometry, magnetic field placement, and
            stability limits imposed by surface tension and gravity. However, these experiments also revealed
            limitations: the magnetic susceptibility of Mn2+ is relatively weak, significant deformation required
            stronger fields or higher concentrations, and optical clarity degraded before large curvature changes
            could be achieved.
          </p>

          <h3>Final Working Fluid: Gadolinium Nitrate</h3>
          <p>
            The final working fluid for this project is aqueous gadolinium nitrate. Gadolinium(III) has one of the
            strongest paramagnetic responses of any stable ion, making it especially well-suited for magnetic
            actuation at practical field strengths. Switching to gadolinium nitrate dramatically increased the
            system's responsiveness to magnetic field gradients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to manganese chloride, gadolinium nitrate enabled greater surface deformation at lower field
            strengths, improved tuning resolution, and cleaner separation between magnetic control and optical
            quality. This shift allowed the lens behavior to be governed primarily by magnetic forces rather than by
            pushing concentration or field strength to extremes.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Not Ferrofluids?</h2>
          <p>
            Ferrofluids were deliberately avoided. Although they respond strongly to magnetic fields, ferrofluids
            introduce significant light scattering and opacity, particle aggregation and surface instabilities, and
            hysteresis due to remanent magnetization. Paramagnetic salt solutions, by contrast, offer smooth,
            reversible, and predictable deformation, which is essential for controlled optical systems.
          </p>

          <h2>System Behavior and Control</h2>
          <p>
            In operation, the system behaves as a continuous analog actuator. Increasing the magnetic field gradient
            increases surface curvature, changing field geometry reshapes the lens profile, and removing the field
            allows the surface to relax back toward equilibrium. There is no discrete \"focus position\" -- the lens
            transitions smoothly across focal lengths.
          </p>

          <h2>Challenges and Ongoing Work</h2>
          <p>
            While the core concept is simple, the system involves several tightly coupled physical effects: nonlinear
            fluid dynamics, magnetic field geometry, surface stability and damping, and optical aberrations introduced
            by non-ideal curvature. Current and future work focuses on modeling the liquid-field interaction
            computationally, identifying stable operating regimes, quantifying optical performance under dynamic
            actuation, and exploring closed-loop optical control.
          </p>

          <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            A magnetically controlled liquid lens offers a fundamentally different way to think about optics: no
            moving solids, continuous smooth control, compact and mechanically simple systems. Potential applications
            include adaptive optics, microscopy, robotics, and sensing systems where robustness and tunability matter
            more than absolute optical perfection.
          </p>

          <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This project is ultimately about rethinking a basic assumption in optics: that lenses must be rigid
            objects. By treating the lens as a dynamic physical system shaped by fields rather than by mechanisms, we
            gain new degrees of freedom -- along with new challenges that are worth solving.
